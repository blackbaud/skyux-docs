<h1 class="bb-page-heading">Icons</h1>

<p>Icons are pictorial representations of objects, important not only for aesthetic reasons as part of the visual identity of a program, but also for utilitarian reasons as shorthand for conveying meaning that users perceive almost instantaneously. {{ stache.config.product_name_short }}  uses glyphic mono-color icons to facilitate, guide and inform users.</p>

<h2 class="bb-section-heading">Usage</h2>

<h3 class="bb-subsection-heading">Context for usage</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Provide quick recognition of common actions and tasks.</li>
    <li>Quickly give added information to a record.</li>
    <li>Denote type or status.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="bb-subsection-heading">Icon selection</h3>
<ul>
    <li>If you need an icon for a new component, determine if it is currently recommended in {{ stache.config.product_name_short }}, and consider where and how to make sure that the meaning you prescribe to it is the same.</li>
    <li>Don't repurpose an established icon for a different action.</li>
    <li>Be mindful of how icons are used in specific components, like list and tile
    toolbars, buttons, and forms.</li>
    <li>If an icon does not add to or facilitate the user experience, then it is best not to use one.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="bb-section-heading">Styling</h2>

<p>Icons will usually inherit their size and color from their parent element, particularly when they are used inline. If you are using icons in a non-inline context and need a different size, FontAwesome provides size multiplier classes. Use the smallest size multiple that accomplishes your goals. If you are applying a different color to an icon, be sure if follows the usage as described in the <a href="../color/index.html">Color</a> documentation.</p>

<h2 class="bb-section-heading">Dictionary</h2>

<p>The following table provides a complete list of icons that are recommended for use in {{ stache.config.product_name_short }}. At present all of the icons we use are from <a href="https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/">FontAwesome</a> as we have found that if FontAwesome does not have a particular icon there is probably not one in common enough use to be immediately obvious to the user.</p>
