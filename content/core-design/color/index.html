<p>As a general rule in {{ stache.config.product_name_short }} color is used to convey meaning, not as pure decoration. Colors should rarely need to be applied directly to an element; rather, components incorporate color as applicable. If a situation arises where color is needed outside of a component that provides it, there is likely a need for a new component to cover the scenario.</p>

<p>Background, border and text colors are derived from these base colors through tinting and shading. Colors used for information visualizations can be found in the <a href="../../components/palette">Palette</a> component</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning">In any situation where text is involved, ensure that the contrast in color between the text and the background is at least 4.5:1 to meet WCAG 2.0 AA accessibility standards.</div>
