<h1 class="bb-page-heading">Icons</h1>

<p>The following table provides a complete list of icons that are available in SKY UX. You should rarely apply icons directly to elements because components incorporate icons as necessary. If a need for an icon arises outside of a component, you likely need to create a new component for that scenario. Note that the table includes all icons that SkyUX currently uses, which means that multiple icons are used for some scenarios. We intend to consolidate the icons to a single option wherever possible.</p>
