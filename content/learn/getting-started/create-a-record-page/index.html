<div class="bb-text-block">
<p>Now that you've learned how to get a <a href="../start-a-project">{{ stache.config.product_name_short }} app up and running</a>, let's build a page with some content. {{ stache.config.product_name_short }} applications feature two common page types: record pages and tabbed pages.</p>

<p>Record pages usually display information about specific records in two distinct sections: a summary section and a tiles section.</p>

<h2>Summary section</h2>

<p>The summary section resides at the top of the page to provide a general overview of a record. For example, it can display information such as a record name, description, and profile picture. To add a summary section to your page, use the <a href="../../../components/pagesummary">page summary directive</a>. Here's an example of a summary section with a name, description, and profile photo:</p>

<div class="page-example">
  {{ include "includes/create-a-record-page/summary-section.html" }}
</div>

<pre><code class="language-markup">{{ include "includes/create-a-record-page/summary-section.html" escape=true }}</code></pre>

<h2>Tiles section</h2>

<p>The tiles section usually consists of two columns of tiles (or one column for extra-small screen sizes like mobile phones) that displays more information about a record in logical sections. Each tile includes a header and body for the tile's title and content. Tiles are collapsible, and if they are used in conjunction with a <a href="../../../components/tiles">tiles dashboard</a>, users can rearrange them.</p>

<p class="alert alert-info">This example shows a page with a static tile layout. To define a dynamic tile layout from a configuration object such as user preferences, you can use the <a href="../../../components/tiles" class="alert-link">tile dashboard directive.</a></p>

<div class="page-example">
  {{ include "includes/create-a-record-page/tile-section.html" }}
</div>

<pre><code class="language-markup">{{ include "includes/create-a-record-page/tile-section.html" escape=true }}</code></pre>

<p>Tiles can display data in all kinds of formats, including a list of fields with their values, a repeater view of records, a chart, or anything else you can imagine. You can find more information about common data elements in tiles in the <a href="../../../components">Components</a> section, but for now let's move on to tabbed pages.</p>
