<bb-alert bb-alert-type="warning">This site describes <a href="https://angularjs.org/">the AngularJS (1.x) implementation</a> of the SKY UX framework. We still support this version, but it is in maintenance mode. We no longer develop features for this version, and we recommend the latest version of SKY UX instead.

<h1>{{ name }}</h1>

<div class="bb-text-block">
<p>Now that you've learned how to get a <a href="../start-a-project">{{ stache.config.product_name_short }} app up and running</a>, let's build a page with some content. {{ stache.config.product_name_short }} applications feature two common page types: record pages and tabbed pages.</p>

<p>Record pages usually display information about specific records in two distinct sections: a summary section and a tiles section.</p>

<h2>Summary section</h2>

<p>The summary section resides at the top of the page to provide a general overview of a record. For example, it can display information such as a record name, description, and profile picture. To add a summary section to your page, use the <a href="../../../components/pagesummary">page summary directive</a>. Here's an example of a summary section with a name, description, and profile photo:</p>

<div class="page-example">
  {{ include "includes/create-a-record-page/summary-section.html" }}
</div>

<pre><code class="language-markup">{{ include "includes/create-a-record-page/summary-section.html" escape=true }}</code></pre>

<h2>Tiles section</h2>

<p>The tiles section usually consists of two columns of tiles (or one column for extra-small screen sizes like mobile phones) that displays more information about a record in logical sections. Each tile includes a header and body for the tile's title and content. Tiles are collapsible, and if they are used in conjunction with a <a href="../../../components/tiles">tiles dashboard</a>, users can rearrange them.</p>

<bb-alert bb-alert-type="info">This example shows a page with a static tile layout. To define a dynamic tile layout from a configuration object such as user preferences, you can use the <a href="../../../components/tiles" class="alert-link">tile dashboard directive.</a></bb-alert>

<div class="page-example">
  {{ include "includes/create-a-record-page/tile-section.html" }}
</div>

<pre><code class="language-markup">{{ include "includes/create-a-record-page/tile-section.html" escape=true }}</code></pre>

<p>Tiles can display data in all kinds of formats, including a list of fields with their values, a repeater view of records, a chart, or anything else you can imagine. You can find more information about common data elements in tiles in the <a href="../../../components">Components</a> section, but for now let's move on to tabbed pages.</p>
