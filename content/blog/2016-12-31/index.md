<bb-alert bb-alert-type="warning">This site describes <a href="https://angularjs.org/">the AngularJS (1.x) implementation</a> of the SKY UX framework. We still support this version, but it is in maintenance mode. We no longer develop features for this version, and we recommend the latest version of SKY UX instead. For more information, see <a href="https://developer.blackbaud.com/skyux">developer.blackbaud.com/skyux</a>.</bb-alert>


Design-oriented updates in SkyUX versions 1.10.2-1.12.0

## Recently completed

### [Listbuilder](http://skyux.developer.blackbaud.com/components/listbuilder/)

The Grid view is now available as a layout option with Listbuilder.

We also added a secondary action button in the toolbar to provide access actions beyond what is provided by default.

## In the works

The team is now focusing on porting components over to [SkyUX 2](https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux2).

## Completed designs

### [Color scheme](https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux/issues/944)

We are going to be making some color changes to improve accessibility and consistency. In general the changes aren’t major, but they will break visual regression tests. A side benefit of this change is that it will allow us to improve our color documentation, which has been a common piece of feedback we’ve received.
