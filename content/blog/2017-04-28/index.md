<bb-alert bb-alert-type="warning">This site describes <a href="https://angularjs.org/">the AngularJS (1.x) implementation</a> of the SKY UX framework. We still support this version, but it is in maintenance mode. We no longer develop features for this version, and we recommend the latest version of SKY UX instead. For more information, see <a href="https://developer.blackbaud.com/skyux">developer.blackbaud.com/skyux</a>.</bb-alert>


SKY UX releases 1.13.10 - 1.14.0 and SKY UX 2 releases 2.0.0-beta.16 â€“ 2.0.0-beta.22

## Recently completed

We have been concentrating on bug fixes, polishing and SKY UX Builder, so there are no new components this month though you may have seen some tweaks to existing components.

## In the works

### Color and typography changes

While technically not in the works yet we are going to be making color and typography changes in the next few months. We want to give a heads up so you can plan for some time testing the changes when you are upgrading to that release. The changes will break visual regression tests, and may effect customized elements depending on how you are referencing the existing colors and fonts.
