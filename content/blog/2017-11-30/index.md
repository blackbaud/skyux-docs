## Recently completed


### [Single file attachment (SkyUX 1)](https://skyux.developer.blackbaud.com/components/fileattachments/)

This provides a lighter-weight file attachment control for use within forms when only one file needs to be attached and the visual weight of the standard file attachment control would be detrimental to the usage of the form.

### [Simple confirmation dialog (SkyUX 2)](https://developer.blackbaud.com/skyux2/components/confirmation-dialog)

This provides a lightweight dialog for confirmation messages where standard modal styling and functionality is not needed.

## In the works 

### [Data entry lookup (SkyUX 2)](https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux2/pull/1220)
