<bb-alert bb-alert-type="warning">This site describes <a href="https://angularjs.org/">the AngularJS (1.x) implementation</a> of the SKY UX framework. We still support this version, but it is in maintenance mode. We no longer develop features for this version, and we recommend the latest version of SKY UX instead. For more information, see <a href="https://developer.blackbaud.com/skyux">developer.blackbaud.com/skyux</a>.</bb-alert>


Blackbaud's SkyUX Sketch UI kit is now available. 

<!-- more -->

If you use Sketch to design products with SkyUX components you can now take advantage of the Sketch UI kit that the Blackbaud UX team has put together. We hope you find it as useful as we do at making prototyping more efficient and accurate!
