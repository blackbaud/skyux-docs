## Recently completed

### [SkyUX 2 beta](https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux2)

We’ve released the SkyUX 2 beta and are continuing to port components over from SkyUX. [Component documentation](https://developer.blackbaud.com/skyux2/) is available; take a look at the documentation to see which components have been built out so far.

### [Grid](https://developer.blackbaud.com/skyux2/components/grid)

Of particular note in SkyUX 2 is a new standalone Grid view component. The original component in SkyUX had a lot of baggage including UI that was no longer needed due to Listbuilder, so the component was rebuilt. Thanks to the MicroEdge team for contributing this component!

## In the works

With our focus now on SkyUX 2, unless noted these will reference SkyUX 2 work.

### [Listbuilder](https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux2/projects/3)

Porting the Listbuilder functionality over will be an ongoing project, the pieces of which can be tracked on the [project page](https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux2/projects/3) on Github.

### [Action buttons](https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux2/issues/319)

These buttons allow for a more pronounced call to action on pages where the user needs to make a choice up front before beginning their task.
