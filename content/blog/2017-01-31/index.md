<bb-alert bb-alert-type="warning">This site describes <a href="https://angularjs.org/">the AngularJS (1.x) implementation</a> of the SKY UX framework. We still support this version, but it is in maintenance mode. We no longer develop features for this version, and we recommend the latest version of SKY UX instead. For more information, see <a href="https://developer.blackbaud.com/skyux">developer.blackbaud.com/skyux</a>.</bb-alert>


Design-oriented updates in SkyUX versions 1.13.0 - 1.13.1 and SkyUX 2 versions 2.0.0-beta.0 - 2.0.0-beta.4

## Recently completed

### [SkyUX 2 beta](https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux2)

Weâ€™ve released the SkyUX 2 beta and are continuing to port components over from SkyUX. [Component documentation](https://developer.blackbaud.com/skyux2/) is available; take a look at the documentation to see which components have been built out so far.

### [Grid](https://developer.blackbaud.com/skyux2/components/grid)

Of particular note in SkyUX 2 is a new standalone Grid view component. The original component in SkyUX had a lot of baggage including UI that was no longer needed due to Listbuilder, so the component was rebuilt. Thanks to the MicroEdge team for contributing this component!

## In the works

With our focus now on SkyUX 2, unless noted these will reference SkyUX 2 work.

### [Listbuilder](https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux2/projects/3)

Porting the Listbuilder functionality over will be an ongoing project, the pieces of which can be tracked on the [project page](https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux2/projects/3) on Github.

### [Action buttons](https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux2/issues/319)

These buttons allow for a more pronounced call to action on pages where the user needs to make a choice up front before beginning their task.
