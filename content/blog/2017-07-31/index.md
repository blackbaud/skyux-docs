<bb-alert bb-alert-type="warning">This site describes <a href="https://angularjs.org/">the AngularJS (1.x) implementation</a> of the SKY UX framework. We still support this version, but it is in maintenance mode. We no longer develop features for this version, and we recommend the latest version of SKY UX instead. For more information, see <a href="https://developer.blackbaud.com/skyux">developer.blackbaud.com/skyux</a>.</bb-alert>


SKY UX release 1.15.5 – 1.15.6 and SKY UX 2 releases 2.0.0-rc.0 – 2.0.0-rc.10

This provides an interactive color picker that outputs color values in a variety of formats.

### [Reorder table](http://skyux.developer.blackbaud.com/components/reordertable/) (SkyUX 1)

This provides a simple reorderable table, analogous to the existing Reorder component.

### Color & typography changes (SkyUX and SkyUX 2) 

We’ve created prerelease (SkyUX 1) and release candidate (SkyUX 2) builds with the [color](https://developer.blackbaud.com/skyux2/design/color) and [typography](https://developer.blackbaud.com/skyux2/design/typography) changes. All SkyUX components and classes will be automatically updated with these styles. If you are using any custom classes or components you may have to make updates to align with the changes. Please note that the documentation for SkyUX 1 is not yet updated (we will update it with the official 1.16.0 release).
