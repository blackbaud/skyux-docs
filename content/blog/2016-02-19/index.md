Design-oriented updates in SKY UX versions 1.5.0 - 1.5.9

<!-- more -->

## Recently completed

### [Page summary](http://skyux.developer.blackbaud.com/components/pagesummary/)
We have begun to create layout directives to streamline the design and development of features using core SKY UX layout patterns. The first of these is the Page Summary.

### [Alert](http://skyux.developer.blackbaud.com/components/alert/)
We wrapped the Bootstrap Alert component to simplify making alerts dismissible and follow SKY UX styling. 

### [Avatar](http://skyux.developer.blackbaud.com/components/avatar/)
This allows for uploading and displaying an image to identify a record. 

### [Error](http://skyux.developer.blackbaud.com/components/error/)
We created a standard layout and styling for error messaging. Now that this core piece is in place we can create a set of standard content for common error types. 

### [Date range picker](http://skyux.developer.blackbaud.com/components/daterangepicker/)
We extended this control to allow a “Specific date range” option in cases where the predefined date ranges are insufficient. 

### Accessibility
There were some elements that were not visually differentiated when in their focused state. These were given a visual differentiation to help with usability overall, but particularly with keyboard interaction.
* Checkbox and radio button
* Context menu button
* Tile header icon buttons

## In the works

### Checklist
We are adding some new functionality to the [Checklist](http://skyux.developer.blackbaud.com/components/checklist/) control:
* Single-select mode
* Standard launcher control
* Standard selected-item view

### Avatar
There is some cleanup work going on around file sizes and error handling.
