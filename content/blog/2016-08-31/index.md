<!-- more -->

## Recently completed

### [Definition list](http://skyux.developer.blackbaud.com/components/definitionlist/)
This provides a responsive layout for simple label – value pairs. 

### [Filter](http://skyux.developer.blackbaud.com/components/filter/)
The filter component enables a consistent and more scalable filter experience across components, improving on what was previously only available in the Grid component. 

### [Modal - full page](http://skyux.developer.blackbaud.com/components/modal/)
This adds a full page size option for Modals for use with tasks requiring complex UI. 

### [Grids](http://skyux.developer.blackbaud.com/components/grids/)
#### Pagination
When using paginated Grids you can now optionally choose to show links to jump to the first and last pages of results.
#### Filters
There is now an option to use the new modal [Filter](http://skyux.developer.blackbaud.com/components/filter/) component in the grid toolbar. The previous filter control is now deprecated.
#### Search
There is now an option to use the new [Search](http://skyux.developer.blackbaud.com/components/search/) component in the grid toolbar. The previous search control is now deprecated.

### [Guideline - Content containers](http://skyux.developer.blackbaud.com/guidelines/content-containers/)
We added a guideline to assist in choosing the best content container depending on what is being presented.

## In the works

### [List builder](https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux/issues/287)
We are continuing with the foundational work to enable list builder view switching. The next piece we are picking up is sorting.

### Guidelines
We are working on guidelines for page layouts.

## Completed designs

### [Flyout panel](https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux/issues/749)
This will add a container to display additional information related to the content on the page. 

### [Multi-section modal](https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux/issues/786)
This will accommodate more complex forms where the content is divided into sections, allowing the user to more quickly find the appropriate content. 

## Upcoming designs

### Inline add/edit
We are looking at inline add/edit to see if there are a set of interactions to standardize on. Currently there are a large number of different implementations across our products.

### Calendar
This will provide a flexible calendar view for displaying event information.
