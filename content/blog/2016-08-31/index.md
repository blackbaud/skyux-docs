<bb-alert bb-alert-type="warning">This site describes <a href="https://angularjs.org/">the AngularJS (1.x) implementation</a> of the SKY UX framework. We still support this version, but it is in maintenance mode. We no longer develop features for this version, and we recommend the latest version of SKY UX instead.

## Recently completed

### [Definition list](http://skyux.developer.blackbaud.com/components/definitionlist/)
This provides a responsive layout for simple label â€“ value pairs. 

### [Filter](http://skyux.developer.blackbaud.com/components/filter/)
The filter component enables a consistent and more scalable filter experience across components, improving on what was previously only available in the Grid component. 

### [Modal - full page](http://skyux.developer.blackbaud.com/components/modal/)
This adds a full page size option for Modals for use with tasks requiring complex UI. 

### [Grids](http://skyux.developer.blackbaud.com/components/grids/)
#### Pagination
When using paginated Grids you can now optionally choose to show links to jump to the first and last pages of results.
#### Filters
There is now an option to use the new modal [Filter](http://skyux.developer.blackbaud.com/components/filter/) component in the grid toolbar. The previous filter control is now deprecated.
#### Search
There is now an option to use the new [Search](http://skyux.developer.blackbaud.com/components/search/) component in the grid toolbar. The previous search control is now deprecated.

### [Guideline - Content containers](http://skyux.developer.blackbaud.com/guidelines/content-containers/)
We added a guideline to assist in choosing the best content container depending on what is being presented.

## In the works

### [List builder](https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux/issues/287)
We are continuing with the foundational work to enable list builder view switching. The next piece we are picking up is sorting.

### Guidelines
We are working on guidelines for page layouts.

## Completed designs

### [Flyout panel](https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux/issues/749)
This will add a container to display additional information related to the content on the page. 

### [Multi-section modal](https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux/issues/786)
This will accommodate more complex forms where the content is divided into sections, allowing the user to more quickly find the appropriate content. 

## Upcoming designs

### Inline add/edit
We are looking at inline add/edit to see if there are a set of interactions to standardize on. Currently there are a large number of different implementations across our products.

### Calendar
This will provide a flexible calendar view for displaying event information.
