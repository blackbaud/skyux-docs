SKY UX releases 2.2.0 â€“ 2.3.1

<!-- more -->

## Recently completed

### Ported to SkyUX 2

-   [Sectioned forms](https://developer.blackbaud.com/skyux2/components/sectioned-form)

## In the works 

### [Single file attachment (SkyUX 1)](https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux/pull/1064)

This provides a lighter-weight file attachment control for use within forms when only one file needs to be attached and the visual weight of the standard file attachment control would be detrimental to the usage of the form.

### [Simple confirmation dialog (SkyUX 2)](https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux2/pull/1209)

This provides a lightweight dialog for confirmation messages where standard modal styling and functionality is not needed.

### [Data entry lookup (SkyUX 2)](https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux2/pull/1220)

This provides a typeahead search control for data entry usage, including single- and multi-select modes. 

## Approved designs

### [Toggle styling](https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux2/issues/1211)

Updates the style for radio buttons, checkboxes and toggles to reflect the recently approved design for icon-based toggle buttons.
