<bb-alert bb-alert-type="warning">This site describes <a href="https://angularjs.org/">the AngularJS (1.x) implementation</a> of the SKY UX framework. We still support this version, but it is in maintenance mode. We no longer develop features for this version, and we recommend the latest version of SKY UX instead. For more information, see <a href="https://developer.blackbaud.com/skyux">developer.blackbaud.com/skyux</a>.</bb-alert>


Design-oriented updates in SkyUX versions 1.6.1 - 1.6.4

## Recently completed

### [Carousel](http://skyux.developer.blackbaud.com/components/carousel/)
The carousel allows you to display a series of items such as cards for the user to cycle through.

### [Phone input](http://skyux.developer.blackbaud.com/components/phonefield)
This is an internationalized phone input to automatically handle validation of phone numbers based on the format required for the selected country. 

### [Key information microlayout](http://skyux.developer.blackbaud.com/components/keyinfo/)
A common data presentation pattern weâ€™ve seen used is displaying a large number with a small label to call out important information. We have created a component to simplify a standard presentation. 

## In the works

### List builder view switching
We have started work on the new listbuilder functionality which will add the ability to switch between different views. Along with this will come some changes to ancillary actions including filtering and sorting, as well as making the toolbar responsive. This is a large project that is expected to take a couple months to complete, although we will be releasing chunks of functionality as we finish them. 

### Design guide
Guidelines for content containers and page layouts are in progress and will be added to the site soon. 

## Completed designs

### [Full page task UIs](https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux/issues/658)
This will allow more space for complex task UIs, and the form will be directly linkable if the user needs to send a specific task to someone.

### [Form/page action bars](https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux/issues/598)
This will standardize the appearance, layout and interactions of action bars between forms and pages (currently there are a few different implementations with very similar functionality).
