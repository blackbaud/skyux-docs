<bb-alert bb-alert-type="warning">This site describes <a href="https://angularjs.org/">the AngularJS (1.x) implementation</a> of the SKY UX framework. We still support this version, but it is in maintenance mode. We no longer develop features for this version, and we recommend the latest version of SKY UX instead. For more information, see <a href="https://developer.blackbaud.com/skyux">developer.blackbaud.com/skyux</a>.</bb-alert>


Welcome to the blog portion of the Sky portal.  Here the members of the Sky team will publish information about the future of the product, share with you details about our process, and anything else that doesn't fit into one of our other documentation buckets.
