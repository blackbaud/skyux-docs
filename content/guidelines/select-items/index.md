<h1 class="bb-page-heading">Selecting items from a list</h1>

In an effort to have a consistent experience when choosing items, use the following guidelines when choosing between the controls that can be used for selecting items from a list.

<h2 class="bb-section-heading"><a href="../../components/check">Radio buttons</a></h2>

Use radio buttons when:

* There are 2-5 options and the user can only select one value

<h2 class="bb-section-heading">HTML &lt;select&gt; field</h2>

Use an HTML &lt;select&gt; field when:

* There are 6-20 values and the user does not need to search for an item

<h2 class="bb-section-heading"><a href="../../components/check">Checkboxes</a></h2>

Use a checkbox when:

* There are 2-5 values and the user can select multiple

<h2 class="bb-section-heading"><a href="../../components/selectfield">SKY UX Select Field component</a></h2>

Use a SKY UX Search Field when:

* The values are user-defined (user-defined fields often end up accumulating a large number of values over time and can become cumbersome with the other controls)
* The user can select multiple and there are > 5 values
* The user can only select one value, but there are > 20 values
* The items need to be displayed with a title and a description
