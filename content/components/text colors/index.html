description: Styling to convey the status of text content.

<h1 class="bb-page-heading">Text colors</h1>

<p>While we use the Bootstrap convention for contextual text colors, our guideline is to use only three of the sub-classes as a way to convey the status of the text contents.</p>

<h2 class="bb-section-heading">text-success</h2>
<p><span class="text-success">This is success text.</span></p>
<div><code>&lt;span class="text-success"&gt;This is success text.&lt;/span&gt;</code></div>
<div class="bb-subsection-heading">Usage</div>
<p>This is used to convey a good result, such as an appeal donation total that is 10% higher than the goal. It should be used to highlight exceptional data in order to maintain maximum visual and informational impact; if too much text is considered "successful" the stlying will carry less meaning.</p>

<h2 class="bb-section-heading">text-warning</h2>
<p><span class="text-warning">This is warning text.</span></p>
<div><code>&lt;span class="text-success"&gt;This is warning text.&lt;/span&gt;</code></div>
<div class="bb-subsection-heading">Usage</div>
<p>This is used when the user should be aware that something is wrong, but they might not need to take immediate action. For example, the due date of a bill that needs to be paid within the next week. </p>

<h2 class="bb-section-heading">text-danger</h2>
<p><span class="text-danger">This is success text.</span></p>
<div><code>&lt;span class="text-success"&gt;This is success text.&lt;/span&gt;</code></div>
<div class="bb-subsection-heading">Usage</div>
<p>This is used when the user must be aware that something is wrong, and they should take immediate action. For example, a bill is past due and needs to be paid now to avoid late fees. These should often be accompanied by other ways of informing a user that something needs attention, such as through a to-do list.</p>
