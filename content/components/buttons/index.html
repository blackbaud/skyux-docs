name: Buttons
icon: square-o
description: The button components create buttons to trigger actions.
layout: layout-container
items:
  - name: Primary
    usage: The primary button triggers the most important or most frequently used action on a page, which takes place in the context of the current page. As a general rule, you should only include one primary button per page to ensure that it draws user attention.
    code: <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Primary</button>

  - name: Secondary
    usage: Secondary buttons trigger less important or less frequently used actions and that take place in the context of the current page. Since secondary buttons are less important than primary buttons, {{ stache.config.product_name_short }} reduces the visual weight to make them noticeable but not attention-drawing.
    code: <button type="button" class="btn bb-btn-secondary">Secondary</button>

  - name: Link
    usage: Link buttons can trigger actions that take users to other pages. They can also trigger actions that drop users out of tasks. For example, you can use this option to create a Cancel button.
    code: <button type="button" class="btn btn-link">Link button</button>

  - name: Inline link
    usage: Inline link buttons trigger the same type of actions as link buttons, but the styling is altered styling so that the buttons fit inline.
    code: <button type="button" class="btn bb-btn-link-inline">Inline link</button>

<p>{{ stache.config.product_name_short }} uses a mix of <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/#buttons" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> and custom button classes, but it provides fewer button classes than Bootstrap.</p>
